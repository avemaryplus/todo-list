# todo-list

An application where you can create your own to-do list.

You can see how the program works at the link: https://avemaryplus.github.io/todo-list/

How it works:

Tasks can be in one of three statuses - "New" → "In Progress" → "Done".

The status of a task can only be changed in this way and only by clicking on the corresponding button.

All tasks are stored in the browser's local memory (localStorage) and are restored when the page is reloaded.
